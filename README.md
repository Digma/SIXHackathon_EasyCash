# SIXHackathon_EasyCash
=======================
Project developped during the SIX Hackathon Fintech by Nicolas Preperier, Igor Fasel and GaÃ«l Grosch. 

EasyCash
========

Manage daily lives transactions with your family and friends much more easily with easycash. Using the API developed by SIX, it becomes very easy to send money to friends and/or businesses. However, the API only offer direct transaction with no condition. By allowing a user or a group of user to set conditions on the transaction itself, it allows a wide range of new applications. 

An easy example is a group willing to buy collectively a tri abroad. They need money to book the house and create a new transaction that will only take place once all the members pay their respective part of the amount. If one of the member did not, the transaction could be aborted before the money is spent. 

Many other application exist where incorporating logic allows new usage.

During the week-end, we develop a concept app to demonstrate the concept and the GUI on a mobile phone.
